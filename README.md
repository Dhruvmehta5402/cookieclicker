# Cookie Clicker Automation üç™
This is a completely useless but fun project made to automate this web game called cookie clicker: https://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/  
## Requirements
You would need to install geckodriver to run the automation. Remember that Geckodriver works on FireFox so you would need to have that installed as well.  
Also install selenium using 
```bash 
pip install selenium
```
## Running
You would first have to change the path of the GeckoDriver depending on where you install it  
You can run the code using
```bash
python cookie.py
```
## Strategy
Currently the code clicks the cookie at a rate of 4 cps. Then it alternates between adding 5 grandmas and 3 Farms and this seems to increase the cps to a fairly high amount although not outstanding.  

## Future Steps
Adding support for Mines, powerups, clicking cookies faster
